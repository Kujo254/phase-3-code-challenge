# Phase 3 Code Challenge: Library Management System

This project is part of the **Phase 3 Code Challenge**.  
It models a simple **Library Management System** using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  

The main goal is to demonstrate:
- Class design
- Object relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Aggregate methods
- Following Python best practices

## üìñ Project Overview

We created three main classes:

- **Author** ‚Üí can write multiple books  
- **Book** ‚Üí belongs to one author and one publisher  
- **Publisher** ‚Üí can publish multiple books, and therefore multiple authors  

This structure lets us ask questions like:
- How many books has an author written?
- Which publisher published the most books?
- Which authors are connected to a given publisher?
